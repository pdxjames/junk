# junk
just junk in here
Adding this line so that the file has a change.
git should note this and see a change in the file.
Now I'll practice commiting the change.
I can also change the file 'in the cloud' ie. do it via a webbrowser
(that's not really 'in the cloud' but it works for my example because I'm using the web browser
as my "server/origin/master" and my terminal as my local repository... which it is.)
