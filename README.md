# junk
just junk in here
Adding this line so that the file has a change.
git should note this and see a change in the file.
Now I'll practice commiting the change.
I can also change the file 'in the cloud' ie. do it via a webbrowser
(that's not really 'in the cloud' but it works for my example because I'm using the web browser
as my "server/origin/master" and my terminal as my local repository... which it is.)

And this is some text I added to the file via the browser.
Sooo...
Since I'm using the browser as my 'master' version, if I make changes here, I will need to pull them down to my local machine.
Done.
